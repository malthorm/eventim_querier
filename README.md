# Eventim querier

Just a script to quickly search Eventim for concerts of specified artists in
a city near me.

- Uses the Eventim public API following this gist: [Eventim Public API](https://gist.github.com/DeveloperMarius/7e8aff4c69ccbf59238d76163c86d9c9)
- Only works for concerts in Germany
- not really tested. Probably brittle
- Schedule to execute with a cron job
